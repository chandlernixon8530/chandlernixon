<h1>No Play Play</h1>
<p>Phishing - when a scammer uses fraudulent emails or texts, or copycat websites to get you to share valuable personal information.
Flaming – the act of posting or sending offensive messages over the internet, mostly called “flames”
Spamming – unsolicited bulk messages, that is, messages sent to multiple recipients who did not ask for them.

	You can’t really compare the 3 because there’s a lot of background behind them that won’t add up but it may follow each other as a sequence. The 3 are different because Phishing is where you see something off the internet and you want it so you try and buy it and they want your email, SSN or your dates and background info on your bank card. Flaming is when you talk about someone or cyberbully. Spamming is when something/one random texts your phone and doesn’t seem to be stopping at all.
